# üéì Binary Analysis of Factors Influencing Student Dropout Rates in Higher Learning Institutions

## üìå Overview
This project investigates the key factors influencing student dropout rates in higher learning institutions using **Logistic Regression**.  
The study explores **academic, socio-economic, and institutional factors**, aiming to provide **predictive insights** and **actionable strategies** to reduce dropout rates and improve retention.

---

## üéØ Objectives
1. **Identify** statistically significant variables influencing student dropout.
2. **Measure** the strength of the relationship between these variables and dropout rates.
3. **Develop** a predictive model to forecast dropout likelihood.

---

## üóÇ Methodology
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
- **Sample:** 462 students
- **Method:** Structured questionnaire
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Analysis
- **Chi-Square Test:** Determine associations between categorical variables and dropout.
- **Cramer‚Äôs V Test:** Measure the strength of associations.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Modeling
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
- **Feature Selection:** Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- **Data Split:** 80% training, 20% testing
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Log Loss, ROC Curve, AUC

---

## üìä Key Results
- **Significant Predictors:** Academic performance, seeking counseling, academic stress, health status, age.
- **Model Accuracy:** 75.3%
- **Log Loss:** 0.531 (low, indicating good probability calibration)
- **AUC:** 0.724 (moderate discrimination ability)
- Variables like **scholarship holder**, **family crisis**, **gender**, and **quality of teaching** had *p-values > 0.05* (less significant).

---

## üß† Insights
- Academic and mental health support significantly affect dropout likelihood.
- Age and health status play a role in retention.
- Certain factors traditionally assumed to matter (e.g., gender, scholarships) may be less predictive in this dataset.
